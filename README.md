# Hybrid Deep Learning for Forecasting (WIP)

This repository will include experiments and evaluation of hybrid deep learning architectures (e.g. LSTM + CNN, GRU hybrids) compared to standard backpropagation networks in time series prediction tasks.

Expected contents:
- ðŸ“ˆ Model implementation (PyTorch)
- ðŸ“Š Evaluation metrics
- ðŸ§ª Forecasting benchmarks (MSE, MAE, etc.)
